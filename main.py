    "This Discord was not made possible by Squarespace. Squarespace is the absolute easiest way to make your website. I've used them for a few different sites. I basically bought that domain to be sure nobody else could. I didn't really have the time or need to create a fancy website, so I just spent about 15 minutes throwing together a landing page. It was incredibly easy with the Squarespace template and, in my opinion at least, it looks great. Now I can give people one link that takes them to a page with the link to all my different social media profiles. You can really create a landing page like this, a blog, a store, really anything with Squarespace and what's best is that you can get 10% off your first order by using the code \"Cucks\" over at squarespace.com/cucks. That also helps you help the message. So please do go check out Squarespace at squarespace.com/cucks.",

    "Brought to you by Raid Shadow Legends. Now you guys know I don’t usually take on sponsors, but I’ve been hearing a lot about this game recently, so I decided to throw some hours at it and give it a try, and I gotta say I’m really liking it so far. For those who don’t know RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is a free-to-play turn-based RPG that’s got like 15-million downloads over the last few months. Google Play even nominated it for an award for being one of its top RPG’s. It’s got a really cool story campaign, active PVP arenas, dungeons, 16 different factions, and hundreds and hundreds of heroes to collect and customize, and they add over a dozen new ones every single month. You can also unlock free champions, equipment, and other cool stuff just for learning how to play, which includes Arbiter (one of the best heroes in the game). As far as graphics go this game speaks for itself. It’s honestly kinda crazy how much detail these guys squeezed into a free game and for your phone, especially when you consider what used to pass for epic mobile gaming not so long ago. Anyway guys RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is constantly expanding and adding new features, so it’s really never a bad time to give it a try. And when you do make sure you use the special link there to get a free epic champion and 50,000 silver as part of their new player program.",
    "Brought to you by Raycons. I actually have a pair of Raycons and I love them. I usually use them when I’m at the gym or I’m at home playing Minecraft.
